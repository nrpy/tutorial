    "(*Note on Authors*: Zach wrote the NRPy infrastructure, as well as this notebook and its Python code; Patrick wrote the first version of the NRPy-based Einstein Toolkit thorns for solving the scalar wave equation in 2018; Terrence rewrote these thorns to the latest NRPy standards in 2020, along the lines of the [`BaikalETK` thorns](Tutorial-BaikalETK.ipynb); Thiago extended the scalar wave initial data infrastructure and contributed fixes to the original NRPy scalar wave notebooks; Leo created the boundary condition animation below; and Brandon established NRPy notebook formatting standards.)\n",
