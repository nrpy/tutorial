    "## Exploring C output and parameter interfaces in NRPy, this notebook initializes core Python/NRPy modules, performs common subexpression elimination (CSE), and generates C code. It further delves into the NRPy parameter interface and demonstrates how Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) paradigms can optimize NRPy generated C code. Additionally, it showcases several advanced features of the `c_codegen` function, including customization options, preprocessing, temporary variable control, symbol substitution, and automatic formatting.\n",
