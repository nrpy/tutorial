    "## This notebook explores how NRPy registers grid parameters and grid functions across multiple infrastructures. It walks through the high-level Python interfaces in `grid.py`, showing how to create scalar, vector, and tensor gridfunctions, how to inspect their metadata, and how to obtain C-style access strings for different infrastructures (BHaH, ETLegacy, and CarpetX). It also demonstrates parity handling, group-based `#define` generation, higher-rank tensor registration, and a small worked finite difference kernel using these tools.\n",
