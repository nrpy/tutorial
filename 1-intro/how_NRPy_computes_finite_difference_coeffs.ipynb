    "# Finite Difference Operators and C Kernels in NRPy\n",

    "## Author: Zach Etienne\n",
    "\n",
    "## This notebook explores how NRPy's `finite_difference` infrastructure converts analytic derivative operators into finite-difference (FD) coefficients, memory access patterns, and reusable C functions. We start from the Taylor-series construction of centered finite differences, then connect this directly to the core helper functions implemented in `finite_difference.py`. Along the way we examine centered, upwinded, and Kreiss Oliger (KO) operators, how gridfunctions are read from memory (with optional SIMD support), and how prototype FD operators are wrapped into standalone C functions.\n",
