    "# Finite-Difference Playground: Using NRPy-Generated C Codes in a Larger Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author: Zach Etienne\n",
    "\n",
    "## This notebook demonstrates the use of NRPy-generated C codes in finite-difference derivatives computation and verifies fourth-order convergence. It invites further exploration of higher-order accuracies and highlights the advantages of NRPy’s handling of complex higher-dimensional expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "To illustrate how NRPy-based codes can be used, we write a C code that makes use of an NRPy-generated C kernel. This is a rather simple example, as the C code generated by NRPy could be written by hand. However, as we will see in later modules, NRPy’s true strengths lie in its automatic handling of far more complex and generic expressions, in higher dimensions. For the time being, bear with NRPy; its true powers will become clear soon!"

    "1. Use NumPy's [`polyfit()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html) function to evaluate the least-squares slope of the above line.\n",
    "2. Explore $\\log_{10}(\\Delta x)$ outside the above (truncation-error-dominated) range. What other errors dominate outside the truncation-error-dominated regime?\n",
    "3. Adjust the above NRPy and C codes to support sixth-order-accurate finite differencing. What should the slope of the resulting plot of $\\log_{10} E_{\\rm Rel}$ versus $\\log_{10}(\\Delta x)$ be? Explain why this case does not provide as clean a slope as the fourth-order case."
