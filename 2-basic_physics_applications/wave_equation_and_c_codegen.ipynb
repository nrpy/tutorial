    "## Introduction:\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to numerically solve the wave equation as an [initial value problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem) in Cartesian coordinates:\n",
    "$$\\partial_t^2 u = c^2 \\nabla^2 u \\text{,}$$\n",
    "where $u$ (the amplitude of the wave) is a function of time and space: $u = u(t,x,y,...)$ (spatial dimension as yet unspecified) and $c$ is the wave speed, subject to some initial condition\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(0,x,y,...) = f(x,y,...)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and suitable spatial boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the next section, we will find it quite useful to define\n",
    "$$v(t,x,y,...) = \\partial_t u(t,x,y,...).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the second-order PDE is reduced to a set of two coupled first-order PDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\partial_t u &= v \\\\\n",
    "\\partial_t v &= c^2 \\nabla^2 u.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use NRPy to generate efficient C code capable of producing both initial data $u(0,x,y,...) = f(x,y,...)$; $v(0,x,y,...)=g(x,y,...)$, as well as finite-difference expressions for the right-hand sides of the above expressions. These expressions are needed within the *Method of Lines* to \"integrate\" the solution forward in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Method of Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have initial data, we \"evolve it forward in time\" using the [Method of Lines](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NDSolveMethodOfLines.html). In short, the Method of Lines enables us to handle\n",
    "1. the **spatial derivatives** of an initial value problem PDE using **standard finite difference approaches**, and\n",
    "2. the **temporal derivatives** of an initial value problem PDE using **standard strategies for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)**, so long as the initial value problem PDE can be written in the form\n",
    "$$\\partial_t \\vec{f} = \\mathbf{M}\\ \\vec{f},$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{M}$ is an $N\\times N$ matrix filled with differential operators that act on the $N$-element column vector $\\vec{f}$. $\\mathbf{M}$ may not contain $t$ or time derivatives explicitly; only *spatial* partial derivatives are allowed to appear inside $\\mathbf{M}$. The wave equation as written in the [previous module](Tutorial-ScalarWave.ipynb),\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\partial_t\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "u \\\\\n",

    "u \\\\\n",
    "v\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "satisfies this requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we can treat the spatial derivatives $\\nabla^2 u$ of the wave equation using **standard finite difference approaches**, and the temporal derivatives $\\partial_t u$ and $\\partial_t v$ using **standard approaches for solving ODEs**. In [the next module](Tutorial-Start_to_Finish-ScalarWave.ipynb), we will apply the highly robust [explicit Runge-Kutta fourth-order scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) (RK4), used widely for numerically solving ODEs, to \"march\" (integrate) the solution vector $\\vec{f}$ forward in time from its initial value (\"initial data\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic algorithm for solving the wave equation [initial value problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem), based on the Method of Lines (see section above), is outlined below, with NRPy-based components highlighted in <font color='green'>green</font>. We will review how NRPy generates these core components in this module.\n",

    "    1. <font color='green'>Evaluate wave RHS expressions.</font>\n",
    "    1. Apply boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We refer to the right-hand side of the equation $\\partial_t \\vec{f} = \\mathbf{M}\\ \\vec{f}$ as the RHS. In this case, we refer to the $\\mathbf{M}\\ \\vec{f}$ as the \"wave RHSs\".** In the following sections we will\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use NRPy to cast the wave RHS expressions in finite difference form into highly efficient C code,\n",
    "    1. first in one spatial dimension with fourth-order finite differences,\n",
    "    1. and then in three spatial dimensions with tenth-order finite differences; we will\n",
    "1. use NRPy to generate monochromatic plane-wave initial data for the wave equation, where the wave propagates in an arbitrary direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the $\\nabla^2 u$ term, spatial derivatives are handled in NRPy via [finite differencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will sample the solution $\\{u,v\\}$ at discrete, uniformly sampled points in space and time. For simplicity, let's assume that we consider the wave equation in one spatial dimension. Then the solution at any sampled point in space and time is given by\n",
    "$$u^n_i = u(t_n,x_i) = u(t_0 + n \\Delta t, x_0 + i \\Delta x),$$\n",
    "where $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x$ represent the temporal and spatial resolution, respectively. $v^n_i$ is sampled at the same points in space and time."
